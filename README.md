## cliWeather

### Description

I made this command line interface weather app using C# and the .NET framework. The used location API is: https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1 and the used weather API is: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1.

At first the city gets converted into the coordinates by the help of an API. These coordinates are then used to call the weather API.
